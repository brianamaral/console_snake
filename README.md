## About
I've challenged myself to build the snake game from scratch with C, no GUI, only using the command line

Unfortunelly the program only runs on windows due to the use of the header file Conio

## Controls
Move the character with AWSD

## The game running
![plot](./gif/snake_gif.gif)

## Usage
Just execute the exe file or compile the main.c with the C compiler of your preference
